#### University Announces Change in Campus Tour Guides

Traditionally, staff members from the admissions office have led the campus tours for secondary-school students who are considering attending the university. Beginning next semester, however, 
current students will lead these guided walks around the campus instead. "The staff of the admissions office no longer have time to lead the campus tours. We need to focus our resources on our other responsibilities," 
explains Christine Tanner, the director of admissions. "Furthermore, we feel that current students will offer unique and valuable insight to our visitors during these campus tours."
