#### University Announces Change in Campus Tour Guides

Traditionally, staff members from the admissions office have led the campus tours for secondary-school students who are considering attending the university. Beginning next semester, however, current students will lead these guided walks around the campus instead. "The staff of the admissions office no longer have time to lead the campus tours. We need to focus our resources on our other responsibilities," explains Christine Tanner, the director of admissions. "Furthermore, we feel that current students will offer unique and valuable insight to our visitors during these campus tours."

- The change: Current students lead the campus tour
- R1: staff don't have time
- R2: current student offer unique insights



#### Daily E-Mail with Campus Activities

The university will now send all students a daily e-mail containing information about campus events and activities. Rather than getting information about activities once a week in the campus newspaper, students will get the information every day, thus ensuring that it is always up-to-date. According to the university spokesperson who announced the plan, "For all of us now, e-mail is part of our daily lives. Students in particular have become used to relying on e-mail and the Internet for most communication, so this is a logical change that will benefit everyone."


- Change: it is going to send daily email about campus events
- R1: ensure it is up-to-date
- R2: students rely on email


#### Energy costs reach sky-high levels
Heating prices, and the university's heating bills, reached record-high levels this year. In an effort to reduce heating costs, the university plans to lower the temperature in all classroom buildings on weekends and on weekdays after five P.M., when the day's classes have officially ended. Because classes will not be in session at these times, the reduced heat should have no negative impact on students and their studies. The university considers it essential that the cost-saving measures not interfere with student activities.

- Change: lower the temperature in buildings on weekends and weekdays after 5 P.M.
- R1: have no negative impact on students 
- R2: save cost


#### Remove Old Bicycles from Campus Racks
I noticed that there are bicycles locked to the campus bicycle racks that have not been moved for a long time. I think the university should remove these bikes from the racks and dispose of them. I recommend this action because, first of all, they will not be missed by anyone, since they apparently have been forgotten by their owners. More importantly, removing the bikes would help to free up space on the racks, thereby benefiting people who are actually using their bikes and need places to park them. Sincerely, 
James Keena


- Change: university should remove old bicycles from campus racks
- R1: have been forgotten by their owners

#### Relict Behavio
In general, animals act in ways that help them to survive within their specific habitats. However, sometimes an animal species may display a behavior that no longer serves a clear purpose. The original purpose for the behavior may have disappeared long ago, even thousands of years before. These behaviors, known as relict behaviors, were useful to the animal when the species' habitat was different; but now, because of changed conditions, the behavior no longer serves its original purpose. Left over from an earlier time, the behavior remains as a relict, or remnant, long after the environmental circumstance that influenced its evolution has vanished.
