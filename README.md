# Speaking

Everday practicing:
- [Daily Plan in Rachel's English Academy](https://www.rachelsenglishacademy.com/enrollments?collection_id=139464)
- Speak out loud of articles
- Speak English mentally using complete sentences


## How to develop and explain your answer

The logic structure of an English answer is:

    D, A -> B -> C
 
 D - conclusion
 
 A - the "root" reason
 
 B, C - intermediate reasons

### Word Bank

Just like the mind map, and note that the content in one circle just needs to be one/two words, not too much!!

From [this article](http://sk2toefl.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_28.html):

排比法和對比法是我思考答案時，很常用的策略，
如果你習慣舉出兩個理由，那我便建議你舉出兩個重要性均等、互相對立的理由，答案聽起來便兼顧了一體的兩面，
常用的幾個對比是 

nature/culture, time/space, individual/society, past/future

> Q1: Talk about a popular gathering place in your town where people like to go.
    Describe the place and explain why people enjoy going there.

```
A popular gathering place in my town where people love to go is my university.
People love to gather there because its classes are open to the public and the
place is surrounded by city parks, so it provides natural green areas for
people to get together and chill while also serves as a cultural platform for
people to discuss issues and to be challenged intellectually. (...)
```

Q3- Q6則更應該注意回答content 的切題度、內文邏輯，結果往往重於完整的過程描述，因為時間不夠，過程可以不用詳細描述，結果則一定要提出，
只要最後的結果邏輯上能和概念連得起來，這題便切題了。

# Writing

## Independent writing
Word bank is necessary in writing as well.

An article should contains three body paragraphs with three clear __topic sentences__ (= the edges in word bank).

Then the explaination and examples in each paragraph are to prove the edge, which means the relationship between two nodes.

## Integrated writing

The key is to integrate reading and listening parts:

1. Main - grep the mains of reading (__skim!__) and listening
2. Details - those in listening are more important than those in reading (must write out __details & conclusions in listening__)
3.
