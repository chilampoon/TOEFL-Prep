__ Here need to define what is efficient first__ ==> get focused

1. Agree or disagree? Students should study in groups rather than study alone.

2. Agree or disagree? Students can get better grades by studying in groups than studying alone.

30.	activities you rather do by yourself than in a group:
    1.	to study ☑️
    2.	to exercise
    3.	to go shopping

63.	Talk about an activity you would like to do with your friends, rather than by yourself
 --> to go shopping

do them alone will get better score

- can speak out loud when I am memorizing sth. and it won't disturb others. feel more comfortable
- ask questions on google and no need to ask my classmates

do hw & study more efficiently -> better score

2. Another reason is, it's hardly for a student to find out what they truely love to do if staying in a classroom. me like coding <- research lab not in classes. 

Those are...
