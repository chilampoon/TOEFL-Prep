Agree or disagree? Parents should not allow their children to participate in any forms of sports (football, basketball, ice hockey, etc.) 
in order to protect them from injuries.

Because, in order to protect children from injuries, parents should make sure children understand their bodies well.
However, if parents donâ€™t allow children to participate in sports, children will not learn how their bodies work.
